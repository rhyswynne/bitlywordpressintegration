Bitly Integration for WordPress (v.0.5)
=======================================

Description
-----------
This is a basic bitly integration for WordPress. Based on the [Simple PHP Library](https://github.com/Falicon/BitlyPHP) by Kevin Marshall & Robin Monks, this uses the `wp_remote_get()` and `wp_remote_post()` (to-do) functions within WordPress.

This will be used in the upcoming (v.1.4.5) version of [Inline Tweet Sharer](http://winwar.co.uk/plugins/inline-tweet-sharer/).

To-do
-----
* Integration with `wp_remote_post`

How to Use
----------
I've kept the function names the same as the original file, please refer to the [Simple PHP Library](https://github.com/Falicon/BitlyPHP) with how to integrate it within your software.
